# DWD: Week 1 Assignment 

## Inspiration 
I had some trouble thinking of what content would populate the pages so I browsed around some old websites to get some ideas. In my opinion the best one I found was this [website explaining how to utilize poptarts in a toaster as a blowtorch](http://www.pmichaud.com/toast/) (the poptarts box looked crazy). 

However after watching Perfume: The Story of a Murderer, I started to look up articles on perfume making and scent. I found two that were interesting: the first one was about 18th century uses/perception of smells and the second was about how to archive scent as data. I used ideas from these two papers very loosely for the site, which is just my thoughts about how I perceive and organize the scents I remember in my life. 

## Documentation Process 
First I made some test pages and made sure my local folder was connected to github after generating the ssh key. Afterwards, I pushed two commits to check, which were successful. 

Even though I had no idea how I really wanted to structure the assignment, I began by making pages about how I perceived smells or have seen smells been described, which were bodily, environmental, or political/metaphorical in addition to the index page. I also included a notes page to list random facts I thought were cool but irrelevant to the other pages. 

I wanted it to be simple and straightforward, since this was mostly for my own recording keeping and amusement, so the index page just has a menu and brief explanation about what the site is. The menu is present on all the pages so the viewer can jump around without having to go back. The title also leads back to the index page. I thought about including some memes 

Afterwards, I linked everything to a style sheet. I thought about doing something like poetry magnets so I gave all the text a border, the menu items a box shadow, and had their display as flex. 

## Deploy to Glitch
On the Glitch site, I went to New Project > Clone from Git Repo and pasted in the https link for cloning my repository.
