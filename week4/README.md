# DWD: Week 4 Assignment 

## Designing API
I was still teetering from my sick this week and did not fully comphrehend everything that was supposed to be completed but I got through as much as I could by referencing workbook solution 16! 

I decided to mostly mirror it to get a better understanding of the different commands and structure. 

## Development
I followed the directory laid out in the assignment. 

## Deployment
I hope I do the glitch thing right.  

## API Documentation
