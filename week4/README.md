# DWD: Week 4 Assignment 

## Designing API
I was still teetering from my sick this week and did not fully comphrehend everything that was supposed to be completed but I got through as much as I could by referencing workbook solution 16! 

I decided to mostly mirror it to get a better understanding of the different commands and structure. I replaced the pizza topping content with some things that made me happy this week. Sadly, there isn't a lot in the file yet but in reality there were a lot of things!

## Development
I followed the directory laid out in the assignment and slowly copied/pasted the solution 16 code while replacing some of the content. The Coding Train videos were also helpful. 

After that I added some css stuff, which was similar to week 2's layout. 

Overall I found it very cool to see how everything worked!

## Deployment
[Assignment 4 on Glitch](https://raclim-dynamic-4.glitch.me/week4/public/)

For some reason I haven't figured out yet why the json objects are not appearing on the Glitch site, but they appear when I serve it locally (seen in photo).
